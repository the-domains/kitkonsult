# Agile Enterprise Architecture

Is there a viable agile approach to enterprise architecture?
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e37ffa35-72cf-45a2-bd4b-35d8e88d1aa6.jpg)

When you dwell into the depths of [TOGAF][0] or [Zachman][1] you discover an extensive toolbox for modeling basically any enterprise architecture. Well, they both are a bit IT centric and some pieces are missing in order to cover an entire enterprise but that's a completely different debate. So let put that aside for the moment. My question is:

Is it possible to combine a framework like TOGAF, or the methodology TOGAF ADM, or Zachman and still be agile?

In my opinion, regarding the TOGAF methodology ADM, most likely no! The TOGAF ADM suffers from the same "disease" as the old Rational Unified Process (RUP). The methodology is too hefty and it encourages a model driven analysis approach that inclines most architects to create large cohesive models and views of the entire enterprise architecture. The models and views end up being more important than the very purpose of creating them. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I find the TOGAF ADM to be a counter-productive force that (most often than not) hampers innovation and productivity.

The frameworks however, I think can be used to some extent to visualize, understand and communicate some key findings that are crucial in the decision-making in creating strategies, changing the business model, outlining projects or prioritizing the project portfolio etc. I also believe that, if used with caution, the frameworks can be useful in implementation governance.

However, if you go all in and start modeling the whole enterprise just because you can, you have gravely misunderstood your role as an enterprise architect.

I think that applying the same set of core principles in enterprise architecture analysis as in agile software development is a key success factor in being truly agile, even as enterprise architects.

Here is my draft of principles in agile enterprise architecture:

* Our **highest priority **is to satisfy the stakeholder through **early **and **continuous **delivery of **valuable knowledge**.
* Welcome **changing conditions**. Agile processes harness change for the stakeholder's competitive advantage.
* Deliver **understandable **findings **frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
* **Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work ****not **done--is essential.
* At regular intervals, the architects **reflects **on how to become **more effective**, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
* Be **architectural evangelists**--the most efficient and effective method of conveying knowledge within an organization is face-to-face conversations.

Remember that your main objective as an enterprise architect is basically to enable a more effective decision-making within the entire organization.
