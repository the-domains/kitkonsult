Let me give you insurers out there some advice when it comes to transforming into a customer driven enterprise.

First of all, realize that despite the use of the word "digital" this is not a concept isolated to IT. It isn't enough to revamp your internet presence or provide your existing products and services through an iPhone app.

Second, understand your business model and identify what need to change and to what extent. Don't underestimate the complexity of aligning your market, service and operating models. This is, after all, where your key driving force derive from.

Third, review and assess your product portfolio. The insurance industry is marked by ancient industry traditions, tight financial legislation and relies heavily on historical statistics when it comes to product composition.

In order to successfully carry out a transformation like this, I believe a critical success factor is to embrace a holistic and coherent approach.
